 # Assignment 1 - HMM Signal Source
 
 The task of assignment 1 is to code and verify MatLab methods to generate an output sequence of random real numbers x = (x1 . . . xt . . . xT) from an Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with scalar Gaussian output distributions.
 
 As is shown in the diagram below, an HMM is basically consisted of two time-invariant objects, a Markov Chain (MC), and an array of Output Probability Distributions with one distribution for each possible value of the discrete Markov-chain state.
