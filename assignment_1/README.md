 # Assignment 1 - HMM Signal Source
 
 The task of assignment 1 is to code and verify MatLab methods to generate an output sequence of random real numbers *x = (x1 . . . xt . . . xT)* from an Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with scalar Gaussian output distributions.
 
 As is shown in the diagram below, an HMM is basically consisted of two time-invariant objects, a Markov Chain (MC), and an array of Output Probability Distributions with one distribution for each possible value of the discrete Markov-chain state.

  ## Pipeline
  
  At time frame *t*,
  - Generate a state *St* by sampling the current probability distribution *pt*;
  - Sample an output *Xt* from corresponding sub-source related to current state *St*;
  - Update current probability distribution *pt* with the transition probability vector *A(St, :)*;
  - Go back to the first step and repeat the whole process.
  
  ## How to run

Script ```verify.m``` serves as an entry point of the whole task.
